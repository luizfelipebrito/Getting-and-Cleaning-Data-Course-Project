The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

XYZ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
The data set was created based on the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
- mean: Mean value
- std: Standard deviation

### Variables
activity -> It can be WALKING; WALKING_UPSTAIRS; WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS; SITTING; STANDING; LAYING as said before.

id_subject -> Unique code that identify who executed the activity.
